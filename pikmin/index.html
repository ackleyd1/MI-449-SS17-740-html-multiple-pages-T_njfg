    <p>Pikmin is one of the single greatest games for the Nintendo "Lunchbox" GameCube. The charming, little pikmin help you gather your ship parts so you can repair your ship and fly back to your home planet to see your family. You can only survive for 30 days on this strange planet that resembles a post apocalyptic Earth. Their determination to fight off enemy creatures to help you return to your planet is admirable. It could bring a tear to a glass eye. It makes me wish these little guys were real :,(</p>
