    <p>Listening to the Pikmin ost brings me back to the very first time I played this game with my brothers and sister on a ski trip at Crystal Mountain. Back then, we weren't proactive gamers looking for new titles to play, they simply ended up in front of us from my mom, presumably to get all 5 of us out of her hair. Lend an ear to a few of these masterpieces.</p>
