    <p>Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo GameCube is the best in the series, hands-down. The competitive scene is thriving, 15 years after its initial release. Even without support from Nintendo, who intended for the game to stay a party game, the community still manages to host large tournaments. There is even a feature-length documentary that charted the early years of this competitive scene. One of the largest tournaments, Genesis 4, is this weekend, January 20th-22nd 2017. I play often with my roommate and I also compete in tournaments, although I perform rather poorly. Yet I keep coming back to "hit the sticks" and play another 8 minutes, 4 stocks, no items match.</p>
