    <p>The Legend of Zelda: the Wind Waker is a classic Nintendo title for the GameCube I hold dear to my heart. The cartoon aesthetic caught my 8yr old eye right away. I recall my quest to max out all my hearts and gather every little collectible there was. It was one of those games where you wanted to beat everything, and once you did, you would play through the whole game again, this time in Link's PAJAMAS instead of the traditional green garments. Also, all of the Hylian text would be translated into plain English. I find myself coming back to it often, and its HD remake is one of the few reasons I got the Wii U.</p>
